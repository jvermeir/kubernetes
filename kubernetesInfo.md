## stuff 

minikube starts a cluster

    minikube start

services (?) running in a cluster:

    kubectl get po -A

A Kubernetes *Pod* is a group of one or more Containers, tied together for the purposes of administration and networking.
A Kubernetes *Deployment* checks on the health of your Pod and restarts the Podâ€™s Container if it terminates. Deployments are the recommended way to manage the creation and scaling of Pods.    

after this

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node

you get a deployment and a pod 

    kubectl get deployments
    kubectl get pods

To make the hello-node Container accessible from outside the Kubernetes virtual network, you have to expose the Pod as a Kubernetes *Service*.

    kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080

    kubectl get services

Open service in a browser: 

    minikube service hello-node

## Build myservice

To connect to the Docker registry inside the Minikube VM:

    eval $(minikube docker-env) # this should use the docker build environment from Kubernetes. 

But how do we use containers that are built locally? For now we'll push to Docker hub.

    cd src/myservice
    mvn clean install
    docker build .  -t jvermeir/myservice
    docker push jvermeir/myservice
    docker run -p 8082:8082 myservice
    curl localhost:8082/counter
    
or use Maven 

    mvn clean package
    mvn dockerfile:push

Don't forget to add a ~/.m2/settings.xml file as described in the blog.  
    
    kubectl create -f src/main/resources/myservice-deployment.yaml 
    kubectl expose deployment myservice-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=8082
    minikube service myservice-deployment  # add /counter in the url bar
        # get the url from the browser and use for curls
    kubectl scale --replicas=3 -f src/main/resources/myservice-deployment.yaml
