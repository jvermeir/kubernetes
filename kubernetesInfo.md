## stuff 

minikube starts a cluster

services (?) running in a cluster:

  kubectl get po -A

A Kubernetes *Pod* is a group of one or more Containers, tied together for the purposes of administration and networking.
A Kubernetes *Deployment* checks on the health of your Pod and restarts the Podâ€™s Container if it terminates. Deployments are the recommended way to manage the creation and scaling of Pods.    

after this

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node

you get a deployment and a pod 

    kubectl get deployments
    kubectl get pods

To make the hello-node Container accessible from outside the Kubernetes virtual network, you have to expose the Pod as a Kubernetes *Service*.

  kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080

  kubectl get services

Open service in a browser: 

    minikube service hello-node
